I have always loved to travel so I wanted to create a CRUD app that reflected that. I chose to do an app that lets Hotels manage their reservations. Some issues I ran into included working with foreign keys in PSQL and getting the edit function to work flawlessly. There are two unsolved problems both concerning alerts. One is how to keep the zero of the timer on screen and have only one alert go off. In the future I plan to add a login area as well as different ways to sort through the guests. I would also like to add a way to block off rooms when another guest has reserved them for a specific date.
